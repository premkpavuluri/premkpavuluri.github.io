To learn about scales visit [Music Scales](/posts/music-scales/).

Scales are made with the tone and semitones. `Tone` means 2 notes from the current note and `Semitone` means 1 note from current note.

### Scale construction:

let's say Tone as W, 
Semitone as H

The scales construction as follows:

Major scale: W W H W W W H

Minor scale: W H W W H W W


### Example:

All notes: A A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G#

**Major scale construction:**

let's take C major scale, the scale starts from `C` note,

 W means 2 notes, So from `C` note `D` note is after 2 notes

 likewise, from `D` note `E` note,

 H means 1 note, from `E` note `F` note is after 1 note.  
 like this we can construct scale.

 C major scale:  C D E F G A B C

 The scale will end with root note
